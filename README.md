## Tech stack
* âœ… MVVM with Clean Architecture
* âœ… [Kotlin Flow][33] - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
* âœ… [LiveData][31] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* âœ… [Coroutines][51] - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* âœ… [Navigation Component][24] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation. asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Safe-Args][25] - For passing data between destinations
* âœ… [Dagger-Hilt][93] - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* âœ… [Room][94] - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* âœ… [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* âœ… [Retrofit][90] - Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
* âœ… [OkHttp][23] - Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.
* âœ… [View Binding][11] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* âœ… [Lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
* âœ… [Glide][27] - for image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* âœ… [Firebase Auth][91] - You can use Firebase Authentication to let your users authenticate with Firebase using their email addresses and passwords, and to manage your app's password-based accounts.
* âœ… [Lottie][45] - Lottie is an open-source animation file format thatâ€™s tiny, high quality, scriptable, interactive, and can be manipulated at runtime
* âœ… [Coil][21] - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
